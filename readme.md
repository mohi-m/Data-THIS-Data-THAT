# Customer Spend Analysis and Risk Management Project

This project focuses on analyzing customer spending behavior, predicting future spending trends, classifying customer accounts, identifying high-risk accounts, and suggesting credit line adjustments. The analysis is performed using historical transaction data and involves building various machine learning models to support decision-making.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is divided into four key components, each represented by a Jupyter notebook:

### 1. *Spend Analysis and Forecasting*
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Notebook:* ‚Å†‚ÄØspend_analysis_forecast.ipynb‚ÄØ‚Å†
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†The goal was to analyze customer spending behavior and predict future spending for *Q4 2025*.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†The *Prophet Model* was implemented to capture trends, seasonality, and anomalies in the data.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Forecasted spending values for *October, November, and December 2025* were generated.

---

### 2. *Customer Segmentation*
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Notebook:* ‚Å†‚ÄØclassification_model_customer_segmentation.ipynb‚ÄØ‚Å†
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†A *Random Forest Classifier* was built to segment customer accounts into categories based on their financial behavior.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Accounts were classified as: 
  - *Eligible for Credit Line Increase without Risk*
  - *Eligible for Credit Line Increase with Risk*
  - *Non-Performing Account*
  - *No Credit Line Increase Required*
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†This helps in making data-driven decisions on credit management.

---

### 3. *Risk Identification*
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Notebook:* ‚Å†‚ÄØRisk_Identification_Model.ipynb‚ÄØ‚Å†
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†An *Isolation Forest* model was used for anomaly detection to identify high-risk accounts.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†The model flagged potentially fraudulent or default-prone accounts based on transaction and account activity data.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†This supports early intervention and fraud prevention measures.

---

### 4. *Credit Line Adjustment*
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Notebook:* ‚Å†‚ÄØcredit_line_adjustment_model.ipynb‚ÄØ‚Å†
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†A *Regression-based Model* was developed to suggest appropriate credit line adjustments for individual accounts.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Factors such as past spending behavior, payment history, and risk scores were considered.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†The model predicts the optimal credit line increase while minimizing the risk of default.
