# Customer Spend Analysis and Risk Management Project

This project focuses on analyzing customer spending behavior, predicting future spending trends, classifying customer accounts, identifying high-risk accounts, and suggesting credit line adjustments. The analysis is performed using historical transaction data and involves building various machine learning models to support decision-making.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is divided into four key components, each represented by a Jupyter notebook:

### 1. **Spend Analysis and Forecasting**
- **Notebook:** `spend_analysis_forecast.ipynb`  
- The goal was to analyze customer spending behavior and predict future spending for **Q4 2025**.  
- The **Prophet Model** was implemented to capture trends, seasonality, and anomalies in the data.  
- Forecasted spending values for **October, November, and December 2025** were generated.

---

### 2. **Customer Segmentation**
- **Notebook:** `classification_model_customer_segmentation.ipynb`  
- A **Random Forest Classifier** was built to segment customer accounts into categories based on their financial behavior.  
- Accounts were classified as:
    - **Eligible for Credit Line Increase without Risk**  
    - **Eligible for Credit Line Increase with Risk**  
    - **Non-Performing Account**  
    - **No Credit Line Increase Required**  
- This helps in making data-driven decisions on credit management.

---

### 3. **Risk Identification**
- **Notebook:** `Risk_Identification_Model.ipynb`  
- An **Isolation Forest** model was used for anomaly detection to identify high-risk accounts.  
- The model flagged potentially fraudulent or default-prone accounts based on transaction and account activity data.  
- This supports early intervention and fraud prevention measures.

---

### 4. **Credit Line Adjustment**
- **Notebook:** `credit_line_adjustment_model.ipynb`  
- A **Regression-based Model** was developed to suggest appropriate credit line adjustments for individual accounts.  
- Factors such as past spending behavior, payment history, and risk scores were considered.  
- The model predicts the optimal credit line increase while minimizing the risk of default.
